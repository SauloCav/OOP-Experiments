# OOP-Experiments-Java

Activities developed in Java using Object Orientation Programming concepts in Java

## Classes
In a nutshell, classes are essentially user defined data types. Classes are where we create a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes. Individual objects are instantiated, or created from this blueprint.

## Objects
Of course OOP includes objects! Objects are instances of classes created with specific data.

## Methods
Methods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about an object, or update an object’s data. The method’s code is defined in the class definition.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes extend attributes and behaviors to child classes. Inheritance supports reusability.
If basic attributes and behaviors are defined in a parent class, child classes can be created extending the functionality of the parent class, and adding additional attributes and behaviors.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation means containing all important information inside an object, and only exposing selected information to the outside world. Attributes and behaviors are defined by code inside the class template.
Then, when an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods are encapsulated in that object. Encapsulation hides the internal software code implementation inside a class, and hides internal data of inside objects.
